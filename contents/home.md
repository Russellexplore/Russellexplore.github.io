My future ambitions are to contribute to the field of urban planning through research, whether in governmental roles addressing pressing issues or in academic settings resolving theoretical challenges. Since childhood, my fascination with maps, spent hours contemplating the geographical distribution of nations and cities, has been a harbinger of my passion for urban studies.
